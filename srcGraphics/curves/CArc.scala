/** Circular arc. Has a rotation counter to allow rotation deltas greater than 360 degrees and less than - 360 degrees. The CArc is intended to
 *  function as closely as possible to the functioning of CArcTails in a curve path. Hence the decision to store the three points as fields rather
 *  using the [[AngleVec]] of the arc which would allow less data. This is to avoid calculation /rounding errors in the start and end points, which
 *  will be used by other [[CurveSeg]]s in curve paths.
